# worldhappinessanalysis

I used python packages such as pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn to perform exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning algorithm predictions to analyze World Happiness Reports from 2015-2020. 

The data comes from csv files which I downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/londeen/world-happiness-report-2020. Main source is Gallup World Poll.

I chose to look at this data because I am curious about the state of the world at a time like this: there is a global pandemic of the highly contagious covid-19 which continues to be detrimental to public health,the economy, and people's mental health in quarantine; social justice movements and civil unrest have increased dramatically with the public denunciation of George Floyd's murder and increasing social media activism; a colossal explosion that destroyed Beirut, Lebanon; and many other things in only the first 2/3 of 2020. Many people may therefore feel unsettled and isolated, so I wanted to see what data I could find and analyze relating to the entire globe overall. This data analysis was a great way to get a picture overview of the state of the world in the past 6 years. In an increasingly globally connected community, it is important to look at the big picture in addition to the details.
