# worldhappinessanalysis

I used python packages such as pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn to perform exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning algorithm predictions to analyze World Happiness Reports from 2015-2020. 

The data comes from csv files which I downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/londeen/world-happiness-report-2020. Main source is Gallup World Poll.
